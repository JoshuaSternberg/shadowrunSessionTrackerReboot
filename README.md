# shadowrunSessionTrackerReboot

The initial commit for this repository is my solo project from Prime Digital Academy, and the basis for my first ongoing 
learning project. The goal is to complete the features that never made it in and to fix any errors. Once the original design
reaches its complete form I'll continue to update, improve, and add new features as I conceive of them.
